Embedding vs Sharding => Hybrid

# USERS

Addresses:
    E -> due to lack of data reutilisation (an address is attributed to one user only), it's an inefficient design strategy to store them separately and referenciate

Shopping Cart:
    R -> due to data coherence and volatility, referencing is preferred. Embedding would create unnecessary read/write operations on data that is very volatile, and sometimes inconsistent


# PRODUCTS

Vendor:
    R -> data redundancy + coherence (+ a lot more products than vendors)

Category:
    R -> data redundancy

Reviews:
    E -> product dependency


# ORDERS

Customer Snapshot:
    R + partial E -> referencing if all data is needed, partial embedding for important/relevant data (we embed the id, name, email)

Shipping Details:
    E -> important data, order-based information

Items:
    R + E
        - R -> item id
        - E -> productNameSnapshot, skuSnapshot, unitPriceSnapshot, vendorId


# Collection List:

1. CATEGORIES
2. VENDORS 
3. USERS without shopping cart (null - empty array)
4. PRODUCTS -> then go back to USERS and update shopping cart with corresponding products
5. ORDERS


Additional indexes:
    1. Categories alphabetical order
        -> 2 partial indexes: 1 for main categories, 1 for secondary categories (main: parentCategoryId is null, otherwise secondary)
